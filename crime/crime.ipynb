    "## Problem: Chicago Police Department facing funding cuts\n",
    "\n",
    "Chicago is one of the largest cities of Illinois, and is widely believed to be one of the most dangerous cities in the US. Although Chicago accounts for only 0.8% if the US population (roughly 2.7 million), Chicago accounts for nearly half of the increase in 2016’s homicides (Sanburn, 2016). Especially in the category of violent crimes, it leads the national ranking with numbers well above the national average (City-Data.com, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Audience: Chicago Police Department and policy makers**\n",
    "\n",
    "The study can help the CPD and the policy maker of the city better understand the problems the city’s police officers deal with, and better allocate the resources in the future. It can also help the public better rely on the resources that the police department is spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who and why should they care?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although measure have been taken to curtail this rampant increase, a large portion of the efforts have been towards spending more on the police budget. The most recent numbers suggest that Chicago spends nearly 1.6 billion dollars on just over 13,000 police officers which work out to be about 123,000 dollars per personnel. This comes under the 2.7 million dollars that the city spends on public safety. And yet the number have not been promising over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the solution of more and specialized police has not been able to tackle the rise in crime over the last decade. Mayor Rahm Emanuel disbanded the Chicago Police Department's anti-gang unit in 2012 in order to focus on beat patrols, which he said would have a more long-term solution to violence than anti-gang units (Wbez.org, 2012). This has been largely criticized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Owing to the recent support for redistributing police funds to more appropriate segments of public safety, the Chicago Police department would be facing budget cuts in the future, which the department has resisted in the past. With a corporate fund of only 4.5 billion dollars (2020), the move however seems inevitable (chicago.gov, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "This however does not guarantee a safer neighborhood or a reduction in the crime rates. So, moving forward, the police department will have to come up with more prudent ways to spend their fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion: Better distribution of police funds to tackle crime\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to study the kind of crimes occurring in the city, their location and see if the police can be better prepared to tackle the rise in crime. The Study undertaken should also recommend the kind of policing required and the timings that they would be most in demand. This can enable the department to be better prepared in terms of the kind of personnel to train and the facilitate better scheduling for the available ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study can prove valuable not just to the city of Chicago, but also form as a better means of reallocating the funds across the state or even on a federal level to better plan and prepare the officers of the law. The study could focus also on the easy interpretation of its findings so as to convince the boards and the government to enable easy and fast approvals for the decisions made in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "On terms of simple changes being suggested, the study could focus on the location data to let officers know about the places that need more resources. The output of the study could act as recommender system for the resources at the department’s disposal.\n",
